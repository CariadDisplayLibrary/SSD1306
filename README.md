SSD1306 Base Driver
===================

This is the base driver for all SSD1306 OLED displays.  It provides
the core logic and control but no physical interface implementation.

You need, also, one (or multiple) of the additional SSD1306_* drivers
(such as SSD1306_DSPI, SSD1306_PMOD or SSD1306_DTWI).
